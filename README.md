# Swordfish

A chess playing engine.

Swordfish is designed to be decent at chess, and at the same time, providing
a set of chess libraries which can be used in other projects.

Some components are inspired by Stockfish.

Swordfish is in development and does not work yet.
Progress to a working version (best if done in order):

- [ ] Move generation
- [ ] UCI protocol
- [ ] Evaluation
- [ ] Search
