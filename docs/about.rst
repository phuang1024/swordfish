About

Swordfish is a chess playing engine. It communicates through stdin and stdout
using the Universal Chess Interface protocol.

If you would like to use Swordfish through a GUI, please download an external one
such as Cutechess.

Swordfish is designed to be decent at chess, and at the same time, providing
a set of chess libraries which can be used in other projects.

Some components are inspired by Stockfish.
